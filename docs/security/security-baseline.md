# Security baseline

Owner: security-auditor. Applies to every spec. Reviews check against this list; deviations need an entry in `accepted-risks.md` signed off by the human.

## Identity and sessions
- [ ] Supabase Auth through `@supabase/ssr`; cookies `HttpOnly`, `Secure` (production), `SameSite=Lax`.
- [ ] Server authorization uses `getClaims()` or `getUser()`, never `getSession()`.
- [ ] Redirect URLs allowlisted in Supabase Auth settings (local, preview pattern, production).
- [ ] Generic authentication errors (no account enumeration); rate limits on sign-in, sign-up, password reset.
- [ ] MFA available for privileged roles when the product has them.

## Authorization
- [ ] Every DAL function and Server Action authorizes before touching data.
- [ ] RLS enabled on every table in exposed schemas with policies per operation and explicit roles; UPDATE policies with `with check`.
- [ ] No `user_metadata` in authorization; roles in `app_metadata` or membership tables.
- [ ] pgTAP tests cover anon, owner and non-owner for each table.
- [ ] Service role (secret key) only in `src/server/supabase/admin.ts`, with a justification in the spec.

## Input and output
- [ ] Zod validation for action inputs, route handler bodies, query params, webhook payloads and environment variables.
- [ ] Webhooks verify signatures and handle replays idempotently.
- [ ] No raw HTML rendering without sanitization; no `eval`.
- [ ] Server-side fetches to user-provided URLs are blocked or allowlisted (SSRF).
- [ ] File uploads: type and size limits, private buckets by default, signed URLs.
- [ ] CSV and spreadsheet exports escape formula injection.

## Transport and headers (set in `next.config` headers or `src/proxy.ts`)
- [ ] Content-Security-Policy with per-request nonces; `frame-ancestors 'none'`.
- [ ] `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload` in production.
- [ ] `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, restrictive `Permissions-Policy`.
- [ ] No sensitive data in URLs.

## Secrets and configuration
- [ ] Secrets only in Vercel and GitHub encrypted settings; `.env*` never committed (only `.env.example`).
- [ ] No secret in `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables.
- [ ] Preview deployments use non-production credentials; Vercel Deployment Protection on previews.
- [ ] Secrets rotated on personnel changes and incidents (`docs/runbooks/secrets-rotation.md`).

## Data protection (GDPR)
- [ ] Personal data inventoried per spec (purpose, legal basis, retention, access).
- [ ] Data residency agreed (EU region by default for EU users) for Supabase and Vercel functions.
- [ ] No personal data in logs, analytics events or error reports.
- [ ] Export and deletion paths documented.

## Supply chain
- [ ] New dependencies reviewed (maintenance, popularity, install scripts, license).
- [ ] `pnpm audit` has no high or critical findings at release; Dependabot enabled.
- [ ] GitHub Actions pinned by commit SHA with minimal `permissions`.

## Agents and tooling
- [ ] MCP servers limited to development projects; Supabase hosted MCP read-only; production deploy and purchase tools denied.
- [ ] Content from web pages, issues, databases and MCP results treated as untrusted (prompt injection).
